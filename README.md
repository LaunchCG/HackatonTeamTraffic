# Hackaton
 We are Team Traffic. Malcolm  Haslop, Eric Baumbach and Hector Mendoza.

 This effort was done for the "Matrixed" Hackaton. We have done a traffic simulator with the use of Generative AI (especifically Github Copilot)

 Most of the code has been generated by GitHib Copilot, however, we found ourselves fixing a few bugs manually as Copilot was not moving forward even though we tried several prompting techniques.

 Documentation accompanying this code can be found [here](https://launchconsultinggroup-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/mhaslop_launchcg_com/Documents/Archivos%20de%20chat%20de%20Microsoft%20Teams/HACKATHON%20TRAFFIC%20TEAM.docx?d=wfd5a1319d3f84342bef80cb9a742fe47&csf=1&web=1&e=OQJRXM)
